# Barrier Monitoring App

An interactive web application designed for real-time monitoring of traffic barriers. This project simulates the management and surveillance of traffic barriers on a dynamic map interface, providing a practical tool for enhancing road safety through efficient traffic barrier management.

## Project Overview

This application was developed to demonstrate skills in creating real-time, interactive monitoring solutions. The project aligns with traffic safety initiatives and can serve as a foundation for more complex monitoring systems. Users can view, track, and potentially manage traffic barriers on a live map, reflecting real-world conditions and monitoring needs.

## Features

- **Interactive Map**: Real-time display of traffic barriers on a map.
- **Traffic Barrier Management**: Ability to simulate monitoring and management of barrier statuses.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed with simplicity and efficiency in mind, allowing users to interact with the map effortlessly.
- **Real-World Simulation**: Provides a practical solution that can be extended for actual traffic monitoring applications.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Angular, CSS, TypeScript, JavaScript
- **Mapping Library**: (Specify if using a specific map library like Leaflet or Mapbox)
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages for easy access and demonstration

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (for local development)
- Angular CLI (if you wish to modify or run the app locally)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
